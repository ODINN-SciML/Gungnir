Preprocessing of topographical and climate data for [ODINN.jl](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/ODINN.jl) using [OGGM](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm). 

Gungnir uses OGGM to generate all necessary files for the initial state and climate forcings to run simulations with ODINN.jl. Before running any simulations for specific glaciers with ODINN.jl, Gungnir needs to initialize those glaciers. We will progressively initialize glacier regions and store them in a server so they are readily available to all users. If you find that some glaciers or a region is missing, please contact us!
